parameters :
    input_ref :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Sample or SampleSet
        short-hint : |
            Select the RNA-seq SampleSet. If you have only one sample of RNA-seq reads, select the corresponding library object.
    assembly_or_genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Assembly or Genome
        short-hint : |
            Select the assembly or genome to align the reads.
    alignment_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Name Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide a suffix to append the individual Reads object to name each Alignment object
    alignment_set_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            AlignmentSet Name Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide a suffix to append the Set to name the AlignmentSet
    read_mismatches :
        ui-name : |
            Read Mismatch Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many mismatches are discarded.
    read_gap_length :
        ui-name : |
            Read Gap Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many gaps are discarded.
    read_edit_dist :
        ui-name : |
            Read Edit Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many edits are discarded.
    min_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will ignore donor/acceptor pairs closer than this many bases apart.
    max_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will ignore donor/acceptor pairs farther than this many bases apart.
    min_anchor_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Anchor Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction. This must be at least 3 and the default is 8.
    report_secondary_alignments :
        ui-name : |
            Report Secondary Alignments
        short-hint : |
            Use this option to output secondary alignments.
    no_coverage_search :
        ui-name : |
            No Coverage Search
        short-hint : |
            Use this option to disable the coverage-based search for junctions.
    library_type :
        ui-name : |
            Library Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the direction of the reads with respect to the original mRNA when the library was prepared. The default is fr-unstranded.
    preset_options :
        ui-name : |
            Bowtie2 Alignment Preset Options
        short-hint : |
            Select the preset options to Bowtie2 for how reads are mapped.
        long-hint : |
            Faster option is generally less sensitive and vice versa.
    reads_condition:
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq reads condition
        short-hint : |
            Set the condition associated with the input reads object. This is required for a single sample, but ignored for sets of samples, since that is included in the set.
        long-hint : |
            Set the condition associated with the input reads object. This is required for a single sample, but ignored for sets of samples, since that is included in the set.
description : |
    <p>This App aligns the sequencing reads for a set of two or more samples to a genome using TopHat2 in order to identify splice junctions between exons with the help of Bowtie2 mapping program. Alternatively, if the user has only a single sample of reads or set of reads, this App will take single-end or paired-end library object or reads set instead of a sample set.</p>
    <p>In addition, it outputs the Qualimap generated BAM alignment QC report that includes global summary such as total number of mapped reads, mean samples coverage, mean samples GC-content, mean samples mapping quality, and sample statistics for each sample along with PCA and coverage statistics in histograms.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone for one or more samples.</p>

    <p><strong>Team members who developed & deployed algorithm in KBase:</strong> Tianhao Gu, Christopher Henry, Shane Canon, Stephen Chan, Jason Baumohl, Sean McCorkle, Sunita Kumari, Shinjae Yoo, Priya Ranjan, Vivek Kumar</p>
